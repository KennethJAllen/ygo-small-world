"""
Module: graph_adjacency_visualizer

This module is a part of the YGO-small-world project, aimed at visualizing the 'Small World' adjacency relationships in Yu-Gi-Oh! decks.
It provides tools for creating and displaying graphs that represent potential 'Small World' bridges and their connections.

Key Functions:
- create_graph: Constructs a graph from deck data.
- display_graph: Renders the graph for visualization.

Usage: Used for graphically representing the Small World connections between Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, aiding in strategic deck building.

Note: Effective for visual analysis of deck structures in relation to Small World card strategies.
Note: Understanding of Yu-Gi-Oh! card properties and Small World mechanics is essential.
